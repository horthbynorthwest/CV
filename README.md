I am a full stack junior developer with an interest in the back-end. My history in film has given me an ability to balance the requirements of many different departments whilst still focusing on the end goal of a project. Coding, for me, is a way to combine many of my interests: languages, logic and creative problem solving. 

Having recently finished [Makers]( https://makers.tech/) 12 week bootcamp I fell in love with clean, well tested code. I also realised that what I cherished about my previous job had significant overlap with writing code beyond problem solving: I get huge satisfaction from seeing how things fit together. In film it was how people fit together and how best to stream line that, in software development it's how code interacts to create the desired end result.

## Skills

#### Communication
Both strong listening and verbalisation skills are key for being successful in film, particularly as an Assistant Director (who are essentially the nervous system of a film set). Different departments and levels within those departments require a vastly different knowledge set from purely technical, to solutions, to key overviews. Over the years I've developed the ability to effectively communicate across all levels with the relevant details, on many occasions I have become the go to for information. This has proven itself to be infinitely useful throughout my time at Makers, both with daily pair programming and group work. 

#### Adaptable
The film industry does not have a formal training path so it was imperative that I was a self starter and that I learnt quickly, it's very much a sink or swim environment. You have to learn very quickly where you fit in within a team and what holes you're going to be plugging. In film no two jobs present the same challenges and that is also true on a micro level too, no two days are ever the same, so being able to adapt to the environment presented is an invaluable skill. I thrive in an environment where I'm challenged: new crew, new project or new framework, there's always a way to get stuck in. This also bled into my time at Makers, both within finding my place within a group and with my final project, which was completed in Python, Django and React all of which I had no prior experience. 

#### Detail Oriented
From proof reading important project documents, to cross checking multiple documents at the same time, getting that consistent detail correct has been something honed under many film projects to the point where it's almost second nature. This also comes across in my code; seeing how the whole codebase hangs together and also being able to trace a bug.

## Hobbies

I love being up a mountain, mainly because it means I'm either taking nature photos, snowboarding, skiing, hiking or I've found any excuse for mountain food.

I'm equally likely to be caught at home doodling, playing video games (Nintendo Switch & PS4) or reading with a good cup of tea.
