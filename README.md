I am a full stack junior developer with an interest in the back-end. My history in film has given me an ability to balance the requirements of many different departments whilst still focusing on the end goal of a project. Coding, for me, is a way to combine many of my interests: languages, logic and creative problem solving. 

Having recently finished [Makers]( https://makers.tech/) 12 week bootcamp I fell in love with clean, well tested code. I also realised that what I cherished about my previous job had significant overlap with writing code beyond problem solving: I get huge satisfaction from seeing how things fit together. In film it was how people fit together and how best to stream line that, in software development it's how code interacts to create the desired end result.

## Skills

#### Communication
Both strong listening and verbalisation skills are key for being successful in film, particularly as an Assistant Director (who are essentially the nervous system of a film set). Different departments and levels within those departments require a vastly different knowledge set from purely technical, to solutions, to key overviews. Over the years I've developed the ability to effectively communicate across all levels with the relevant details, on many occasions I have become the go to for information.

#### Adaptable
In film no two jobs present the same challenges and that is also true on a micro level too, no two days are ever the same, so being able to adapt to the environment presented is an invaluable skill. I thrive in an environment where I'm challenged: new crew, new project, new language there's always a way to get stuck in.

#### Self Driven Quick Learner 

The film industry does not have a formal training path so it was imperative that I learnt quickly, it's very much a sink or swim environment. This also bled into my time at Makers, my final project was completed in Python, Django and React all of which I had no prior experience. Python has continued to be a loved part of my post-Makers learning journey.

#### Detail Oriented

From proof reading important project documents, to cross checking multiple documents at the same time, getting that consistent detail correct has been something honed under many film projects to the point where it's almost second nature. This also comes across in my code; seeing how the whole code hangs together and also being able to trace a bug.

## Experience

	 - Being aware of financial implications of filming requirements and highlighting them to allow for a happy medium.
 - Responsible for a budget of £1.2 million

	 - The first shot has changed and needing to react efficiently to the news to get what is needed done within the time remaining.
	 - The shooting schedule has changed and we needed to book dancers for additional days that have not been budgeted or checked for.
	 - The weather is bad so we're changing the order of what we're shooting. The dancers you have coming in at 2pm are now needed to be in at 11am. It's 9:00am.

## Hobbies

I love being up a mountain, mainly because it means I'm either taking nature photos, snowboarding, skiing, hiking or I've found any excuse for mountain food.

I'm equally likely to be caught at home doodling, playing video games (Nintendo Switch & PS4) or reading with a good cup of tea.
