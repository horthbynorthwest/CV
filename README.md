## Georgie Horth

I am an experienced freelance Film Assistant Director (AD) looking to take my first steps into the world of software development. Assistant Directors (ADs) are the lifeblood of a film production, who often have to problem solve on the fly within a set of requirements. The constant shifting environment of film meant that two days were rarely the same, this means that adaptablity is paramount to effectively find solutions. I see coding as a way to combine many of my interests: languages, logic and creative problem solving.

## Hobbies

I love being up a mountain, mainly because it means I'm either taking nature photos, snowboarding, skiing, hiking or I've found any excuse for mountain food.

I'm equally likely to be caught at home doodling, playing video games (Nintendo Switch & PS4) or reading with a good cup of tea.
